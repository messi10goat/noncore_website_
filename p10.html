         Product Manager - Intern
      </h3>
      <br>
      <h3 style="color: red; margin: 4px;" >
        Can you give a general discription of the interview with some interview questions? 
      </h3>
      <h3 style="color: white; margin: 4px;">
        Round 1: Behavioral Interview <br>
Questions on my last summer internship, PORs at college etc.<br>
I would say, my experience at Enactus was very helpful since there I got to work on an entrepreneurial project and most of the Product Manager roles require that sort of experience and it gave me a lot of talking points in the interview as well. In fact, I was shortlisted for one more internship at one of the biggest Hospital Chain in India (which unfortunately got cancelled) there also I was quite grilled upon my past experience at Enactus.<br>

Round 2: Product Case Study Assignment<br>
Task was to prepare a Product strategy to improve the conversion rate (free users to paid users). Time duration of task was 3 days. 
      </h3>
      <br>
      <h3 style="color: red; margin: 4px;" >
        How did you prepare for it?
      </h3>
      <h3 style="color: white; margin: 4px;">
        I solved the case studies on a regular basis. But what helped the most was the interaction with Product Managers at different firms because this role is quite new in Indian Market and does not have any standard hiring procedure so, interacting with right people helped in understanding the hiring procedure in a better manner. More than I solved cases myself I read the solved case studies by prominent PMs which really helped me step up my game.

        Any tips for juniors?
      </h3>
      <h3 style="color: white; margin: 4px;">
        I would say, explore different profiles as much as you can. Talk to experienced people, alums to understand the profile better. As far as preparation and all is concerned you will figure that out once you have decided what is more suitable for you. In general, keep practicing case studies and solve puzzles on a regular basis that should be sufficient and obviously make a role specific CV.
