        Can you give a general discription of the interview with some interview questions? 
      </h3>
      <h3 style="color: white; margin: 4px;">
        The first round consisted of normal aptitude questions inclusive of quantitative, non-verbal, and a little of vocabulary based questions. The second round was a group discussion round with 8-9 people per group and the topics were very general for two other groups and a current affair topic for our group. The last round was a personal interview where they mainly focus on guesstimates, puzzle-solving abilities, and quick calculation skills.

        How did you prepare for it?
      </h3>
      <h3 style="color: white; margin: 4px;">
        For the first round, I would suggest practicing online aptitude questions and building up your speed for these type of online rounds, even for other non-core companies. Also, keep practicing the puzzles available on InterviewBit and GeeksforGeeks as they would help you a lot in almost every other non-core and it company. For the group discussion, if you are confident about your proficiency in English, then just keep following news a little bit.Also, I would suggest to enhance your vocabulary as it helps when you use better words than others.

        Any tips for juniors?
      </h3>
      <h3 style="color: white; margin: 4px;">
        I would suggest juniors to target companies but prepare for the job roles. This is not the time to be indecisive and uncertain. As an average student during these 4 years, I was too worried about my placements, but if you are just above the cutoff then you need not worry about it. Just be very clear about the company and start preparing for it as soon as possible. All the best.
