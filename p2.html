        Can you give a general discription of the interview with some interview questions? 
      </h3>
      <h3 style="color: white; margin: 4px;">
        The first round was an aptitude test. A case study was also given to us prior to the test and then some questions were asked based upon it. The second round was interview round. Various questions were asked. Some of them were about basics of financial markets, speed maths, some about involvement in extra-curricular activities, PORs and rest were general questions but based upon those they determined whether a candidate is fit for the job or not as the trading profile requires a certain set of personality traits and skills. One of the question that was asked from all candidates was, "What is the biggest risk you have taken?

        How did you prepare for it?
      </h3>
      <h3 style="color: white; margin: 4px;">
        I started reading ''Finshots" and some articles on Economic Times and Inshorts.I practiced some basic questions generally asked in aptitude tests and speed maths.I had not solved many case studies but a good practice of them is recommended. I also learnt some basics of Financial markets and futures.

        Any tips for juniors?

        First of all maintain a decent CGPA. It does not guarantee you a job/internship but allows you to register for each company coming to the campus. Start reading financial news. It will definitely help you in any non-core interview. Practice case studies and case interviews concepts. If you have time learn SQL or Excel but it is not necessary as you can learn them while doing internship also but it helps you in the internship itself and might give you an edge over other candidates.Have a story in mind that why you are pursuing non-core. Blunt answers like, "Because I don't like my core" do not create a good impression. Take up PORs but only if you believe you can manage a decent CGPA. PORs definitely help in non-core profiles but only if you can convince the interviewer that you have developed some skills by them and have done justice to your responsibilities.Have a basic knowledge about concepts related to the job profile. Example: in the case of Futures First, a basic knowledge about the derivatives market will help you. Lastly, have a good resume!
